# Bachelor-thesis on One energy proton beam range modulator

The "try_code.m" file has example codes of how the range modulators can be used, with different pre-defined CTs, CSTs and range modulators. 

The "modulators" folder contains all of the developed or in development modulators.
"Box_modulator.m" is stable and has instructions on how it should be used. 
"new_PTV_shaped_coned_inverse_good.m" is the last of the modulator series and should take the shape of the PTV and make a cutout in the Box modulator and then take the other half of the shape of the PTV and shape the cones like it. It is still a work in progress and needs some parameters optimizing, in order to get an optimal result.
